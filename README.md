Hi, I'm Clemens

I am currently learning Python and building small projects to improve my programming skills step by step.
My main interests and goals include:

🔸 Python development
🔸 Web scraping and automation
🔸 Building practical tools for business use

My aim is to turn these skills into real products and services that I can sell in the future.

This GitHub profile documents my progress and experiments while I continue learning.
